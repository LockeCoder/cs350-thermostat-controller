# CS350-final-thermostat-controller
Thermostat controller final project artifact (CS-350).

This repository includes the CS-350 final project artifact that demonstrates embedded systems fundamentals: GPIO input/output, I2C sensor integration, LCD output, UART telemetry, and state-driven program design.

## Artifact 1 (Primary): Thermostat Controller Final Project
What it is: A thermostat-style controller that reads temperature/humidity data from an AHT20 sensor over I2C, displays system status on a 16x2 LCD, and uses buttons (mode/up/down) to change operating mode and adjust a set point. LEDs indicate heating/cooling behavior based on the current mode and temperature conditions. UART output provides periodic telemetry.

## System Design (State Machine)
The software uses three modes/states: OFF, HEAT, and COOL, with transitions controlled by the mode button. The state-machine design is documented in the diagram included in this repository.

## LED behavior requirements implemented:
HEAT:
• If temp < setpoint → red LED fades (actively heating)  
• If temp >= setpoint → red LED solid (heating on but satisfied)  

COOL:
• If temp > setpoint → blue LED fades (actively cooling)  
• If temp <= setpoint → blue LED solid (cooling on but satisfied)  

OFF:
• Both LEDs off

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This artifact demonstrates the construction of an embedded-style control system on a Raspberry Pi that integrates multiple hardware components: LCD output, button input, LED status indicators, and I2C sensor communication. The problem being solved is to create a reliable, testable thermostat-style application that reads real-world data, presents it clearly to the user, and responds to user input with predictable state-driven behavior while also producing periodic telemetry.

## What did you do particularly well?
I performed particularly well at implementing clear requirements and validating behavior through structured integration. I built the system around explicit pin mappings, state logic, timed behaviors (LCD refresh and UART output interval), and PWM-based LED behavior to represent “active vs. satisfied” states. I also used runtime output and repeatable test sequences to verify button presses, state transitions, and sensor-driven behavior.

## Where could you improve?
I can improve how I validate and demonstrate requirements under time pressure, especially during recordings. Going forward, I will use a short checklist that forces each condition (heat running, heat satisfied, cool running, cool satisfied, off) and verifies it visually before recording so that all rubric elements are clearly demonstrated.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding a more formal verification workflow: wiring validation checklists, consistent I2C verification steps (device detection and address confirmation), and repeatable test scripts/checklists for triggering each state transition, LED condition, and LCD behavior prior to submission. I will continue using lab guides/rubrics as requirement references and use targeted debug output to confirm runtime behavior.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
### Transferable skills include:
• Hardware/software integration (GPIO input/output + I2C sensor communication + LCD output + UART telemetry)  
• Debugging discipline (baseline → isolate → test one change → verify)  
• State-machine and loop-based design for predictable control behavior  
• PWM-based LED signaling for “active vs. satisfied” system states  
• Validation practices using observable outputs (LCD/LED) and repeatable test sequences  

These apply directly to future embedded projects and any system that requires reliable integration and troubleshooting.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the project maintainable by separating responsibilities (sensor reads, LED updates, LCD updates, UART output, and button handling) and driving behavior through a small set of states. This structure makes it easier to extend the project (new states, different sensors, alternate display formats, different telemetry intervals) without rewriting large sections of code.
